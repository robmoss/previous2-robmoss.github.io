A steadily-increasing number of students and postdocs in our group find
themselves needing to run huge numbers of model simulations, and the path of
least resistance --- using their local desktop or laptop --- simply isn't
feasible.
Thankfully we have the [Nectar Cloud](https://nectar.org.au/research-cloud/)
at our disposal!
I've been helping several people in our group transition to this platform, and
this has prompted me to prepare several step-by-step tutorial for the
different needs I've encountered so far.
It's my intention to make these all available online, and the first cab off
the rank is [how to create a MATLAB VM]({{ site.baseurl

I have written an initial draft of a tutorial that describes [how to produce
simple plots]({{ site.baseurl }}/model/tools/plotting-with-d3) using the
`D3.js` library, as per the [interactive plots]({{ site.baseurl }}/model/rfc/)
I have previously made available.
Please try this out and let me know what you think!

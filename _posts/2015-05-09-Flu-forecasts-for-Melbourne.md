Our first trial of *live* influenza forecasting for metropolitan Melbourne is
now [available online]({{ site.baseurl }}/2015-flu-forecasts/), using
publicly available [surveillance data](http://ideas.health.vic.gov.au/).
It will be very exciting to see how the forecasts evolve in the coming months!

And yes, the animated plots are
[built](https://github.com/robmoss/2015-flu-forecasts/blob/gh-pages/plot.js)
with `D3.js`.

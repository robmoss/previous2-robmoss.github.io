Modelling involves more than simply creating a model and analysing its
behaviour; for a model to be *useful* to an audience beyond the author(s) it
must be documented in a thorough and precise manner, so that an independent
reader can replicate the model results (and potentially extend the model
itself).

## Hormonal regulation of salt and water excretion

This whole-kidney model predicts steady-state salt and water excretion rates
in response to renal pressure and circulating hormone levels, as illustrated
in these [interactive plots](./rfc/).

## Afferent arteriole autoregulation

[This model](./aa-autoreg) extends an existing autoregulatory model with the
addition of an explicit glomerular capillary bed, in order to predict the
glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

## Interactive SEIR infectious disease model

This
[interactive model](http://mathmodelling.sph.unimelb.edu.au/~rgm/seir-demo/)
illustrates how epidemiological parameters, such as the basic reproduction
number, affect the size and duration of an epidemic.

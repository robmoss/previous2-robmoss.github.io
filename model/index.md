Modelling involves more than simply creating a model and analysing its
behaviour; for a model to be *useful* to an audience beyond the author(s) it
must be documented in a thorough and precise manner, so that an independent
reader can replicate the model results (and potentially extend the model
itself).

## Hormonal regulation of salt and water excretion

This whole-kidney model predicts steady-state salt and water excretion rates
in response to renal pressure and circulating hormone levels, as illustrated
in these [interactive plots](./rfc/).

## Afferent arteriole autoregulation

[This model](./aa-autoreg) extends an existing autoregulatory model with the
addition of an explicit glomerular capillary bed, in order to predict the
glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

## Interactive SEIR infectious disease model

This
[interactive model](http://mathmodelling.sph.unimelb.edu.au/~rgm/seir-demo/)
illustrates how epidemiological parameters, such as the basic reproduction
number, affect the size and duration of an epidemic.

## Interactive SIR infectious disease model

This
[interactive model](http://mathmodelling.sph.unimelb.edu.au/~rgm/sir-demo/)
illustrates how outbreaks in small populations are driven by stochastic
events.
It is designed for use in a talk or presentation, where the model population
size can be set to the number of people in the audience $$N$$, each of whom
should be given a unique number from $$\{1 \dots N\}$$.

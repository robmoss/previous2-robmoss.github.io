### Advanced Modelling: Case Studies (MAST90080)

In this course I will discuss the role the kidneys play in *homeostasis*,
introduce some basic renal physiology concepts, and present an overview of
several mathematical models of whole-kidney function and renal blood flow
autoregulation.

### Mathematics for Biomedicine (MAST10016)

In this guest lecture I will introduce several applications of mathematical
modelling to renal physiology and infectious disease epidemiology, with an
emphasis on the breadth of research applications available to people with
strong mathematical skills.

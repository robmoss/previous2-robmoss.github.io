Early detection and [forecasting]({{ site.baseurl }}/2015-flu-forecasts/) of
infectious disease epidemics through the use of Bayesian estimation and
mechanistic models of infection.
Mathematical modelling of containment strategies for epidemic diseases within
logistical constraints of existing healthcare systems, of medical and
immunological control of viral infections, and of in-host viral mutation as a
result of selection pressure.

The goals of this work are to understand and account for the real-world
constraints that limit the ability to identify extant epidemics, to intervene
appropriately, and to reduce endemic burden.
The outcomes of this work are to inform health-care policy on the grounds that
what is good for the population is good for the country.

This work is aligned with the *Understanding and controlling influenza and
other respiratory viruses* theme of the [PRISMÂ²](http://prism.edu.au/) Centre
for Research Excellence.

Mathematical modelling of renal physiology, working towards steady-state and
transient models of whole-organ function (e.g., water and sodium excretion) as
regulated by
[neurohormonal feedback](http://www.handwrittentutorials.com/videos.php?id=42)
under physiological and pathological states, and in response to
pharmacological interventions.
See these [interactive plots]({{ site.baseurl }}/model/rfc/) that compare
model excretion rates against data from studies of acute pressure natriuresis
in the rat.

There are many potential applications, from teaching medical students to
assisting doctors with diagnoses and delivering personalised health-care.
This is of particular interest due to the ever-increasing burden of
kidney-related diseases such as essential hypertension and diabetes.

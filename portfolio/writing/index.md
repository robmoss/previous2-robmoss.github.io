title: Writing Advice
---

It isnâ€™t easy to write a great CV/cover letter/research statement/teaching
statement.
Thankfully many people and institutions have posted articles, samples,
templates and checklists to help the inexperienced researcher.
If anything, the problem is perhaps that there is too much advice.
Either way, I have a list of articles that I found useful.
